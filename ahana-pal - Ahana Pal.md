### Tesseract Coding- NeoAlgo

I am [Ahana Pal](https://github.com/ErzaTitania-2001), an undergraduate student from [RCCIIT](https://www.rcciit.org/), [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata), as part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/). 
I was a part of project [NeoAlgo](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo) for WoC. My work over the winter helped expand the project and make it more diverse in terms of algorithm.
My project was mentored by : 
[Rajiv Singh](https://github.com/iamrajiv)
[Abhinav Anand](https://github.com/atarax665)
[Harsh Bandhan Mishra](https://github.com/HarshCasper)

# Future Scope
I believe that my contribution would aid in the fulfillment of the aim of Project NeoAlgo. I would look forward to see the following in NeoAlgo : 

- Vast library of algorithm
- More algorithms in uncommon languages such as Go, Kotlin, etc.
- Diverse complex mathematical algorithms


# Overall Experience

I had an enriching and exciting winter of 2020, working on NeoAlgo under the  [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/)  program. I was glad to be mentored by Rajiv Singh,  Abhinav Anand, Harsh Bandhan Mishra (thanks for going through all my PRs!) and Shraddha, (who was an important source of issues regarding the algorithms throughout). I express my sincere thanks to all students who worked on NeoAlgo as part of Tesseract Coding, and my peers working as part of WoC.



WoC with NeoAlgo was a warm and unforgettable experience for me. Everytime I talk of Open Source, NeoAlgo will be remembered fondly.
