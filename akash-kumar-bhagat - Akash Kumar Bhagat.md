## New Features : 
 [#1660](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1660) - As requested by my mentor Harsh Bardhan Mishra, I have introduced a very versatile, flexible and informative coding template which I have implemented myself in all of my contributions. The coding template is implemented in python for most of my code. This aimed to maintain the quality, simplicity and consistency of the contributions. For more information about the template,  refer to the Issue [#1650](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1650).

 I also proposed for the addition of folders for some of the very important algorithms such as Backtracking Algorithms and Pathfinding Algorithms

- Backtracking Algorithms:
	- [#1538](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1538) - N-Queens Problem
	- [#1504](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1504) - Subset Sum Problem
	- [#1505](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1505) - Knight's Tour
	- [#1522](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1522) - Hamiltonian Cycle

- Path Finding Algorithms:
	- [#1828](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1828) - BFS in 2D Maze
	- [#1841](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1841) - DFS in 2D Maze (Recursive)
	- [#1853](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1853) - DFS in 2D Maze (Iterative)
	- [#1901](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1901) - Dijkstra's Algorithm in 2D Maze
	- [#1932](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1932) - A*(Astar) Algorithm in 2D Maze

## Bug Fixed:

- [#1426](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1426) - Logical bug fixed in Python/maths/prime_number.py which resulted in undesirable results with some inputs.
- [#1610](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1610) - Re-Structured the `README.md` file under Python  folder. The file unordered and had duplicate links for the same problem. PR [#1623](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1623)

## Future Scope
 I would like to keep contributing some awesome algorithms to the projects and keep in touch with the mentors. I will continue reviewing some PRs and ensure quality contributions in the coming future.

## Overall Experience
The entire month was very productive for me. I have learned many things about the work culture and the uses of git which I was unaware. The complete positive feedback from the mentors helped me growing and improving. The mentors were very resourceful throughout the program and also encouraged us for many contributions. It was an awesome experience to be a part of DSC-NSEC's Winter of Code.
I want to take this moment to DSC-NSEC for such an initiative to give the students a platform to start their Open Source Journey. I would also like to thanks our mentors Harsh Bardhan Mishra, Rajiv Singh and Abhinav Anand for their constant guidance and support.
