### eduAlgo : Documentation

The project was an improvement of UI/UX to a [documentation](https://edualgo.github.io/documentation/) page of **eduAlgo Pyhton Package**. My work throughout the winter made the website somewhat responsive and good looking.

This project was mentored by -  [Abhijit Tripathy](https://github.com/Abhijit2505).
# Contributions
2 [commits](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/commits?author=AmitManna99) 
  - **Updated Software Release Page with JS**
Previously the page was hardcoded. 
[#10](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/pull/10) In this commit, I created a JSON which contain all the key-value pair of all information regarding each SW Release. For next SW Release, maintainer can add the information to the JSON. The Webpage will automatically fetch the details and repeatedly render on webpage.

- **Functional and UI Improvement**
[#11](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/pull/11) In this commit, I added this following features -

		1. Added a Copy Button to each Code Blocks
		2. Changed the Color Scheme for Coding Section to look beautiful and easier to notice.
		3. Added a "Under Maintenance" Page so that if a webpage is not ready or under maintenance will redirect to this Page
		4. Change the Scrollbar look.
  
# New Features

# Future Scope

# Overall Experience

I had an enriching and exciting winter of 2019, working with **eduAlgo** under the  [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/)  program. I was glad to be mentored by Abhijit Tripathy (thanks for going through all my PRs!). I express my sincere thanks to all  my peers working as part of WoC.

WoC with eduAlgo was a nice and unforgettable experience for me. Everytime I talk of Open Source, WoC will be remembered as this is my very first Open Source program.
