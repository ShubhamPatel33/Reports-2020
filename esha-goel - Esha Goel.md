### Tesseract Coding : NeoAlgo
The project is aimed at bringing all data structures and algorithms under one roof.It also contains step-wise explanations to various algorithms.My work made it more user friendly for first time users and for people who are new to coding.<br>
I am Esha Goel, a sophomore in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Shiv Nadar University,Greater Noida.<br>
# Contributions
8 commits<br>
- Articles on various Algorithms<br>
- Circular Linked List Implementation<br>
  
# New Features
- I was reponsible for building the resources directory of the project which contains various articles briefly explaining the concepts and their applications.<br>
Issue : #1541 https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1541 <br>
I have contributed articles on following topics -<br>
##### 1.Bubble Sort
##### 2.Selection Sort
##### 3.Linear Search
##### 4.Heap Sort
##### 5.Counting Sort
##### 6.Radix Sort

- I contributed the code for Circular Linked List implementation. It contains all the functions which can be performed on the circular linked list for eg.insertion, deletion,search,sorting at beginning, end or at any position in the linked list.<br>

# Future Scope
The WiKi section of the project should also be focussed upon because for a beginner who has just started to code, they not just need the code but also the explanation of the algorithms.If a person has infront of him explaining the algorithm step-wise, discussing its application and explaining its time complexity, all of which will make the process of learning really easy.There is so much to add about.<br>
# Overall Experience
I got to learn so many new things from the participating students and the mentors of course.I extended my gratitude to Harsh, Shradha, Sri Manikanta Palakollu and Rajiv whose comments/reviews helped me in a number of my PRs.WoC with Tesseract Coding was a warm and unforgettable experience for me.
