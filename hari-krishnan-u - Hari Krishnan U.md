### DSC NSEC : Algorithms

### Overview

The project is a collection of Problems and thier Solutions based on Data Structures and Algorithms, that proves to be helpful for one in competitive coding and Open source and the
questions has been designed based on the popular multiplayer game Among Us. The project helps one student in thier journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms. My work over
the winter was to add solutions(well-commented) to these problems along with thier Editorials.

I am [Hari Krishnan U](https://github.com/Harikrishnan6336) an under-graduate student from [CET](https://www.cet.ac.in/), Kerala as part of [Winter of Code](https://winterofcode.com/)

This project was mentored by [Anjali Jha](https://github.com/anjali1903), [Shailly Keshari](https://github.com/shaillykeshari) and [Joydeep Das](https://github.com/OverLordAct).

# Contributions

[commits](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/commits?author=Harikrishnan6336)

- Added solutions to problems in Array such as missing_id, push_zero, weird_sorting in C++
- Added solutions to problems in String such as malfunctioning_keyboard, unique_char in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Recursion such as climb_stairs, pattern in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Stack such as substitution, destroy_asteroids, priority_tasks in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Linked List such as grouping, remove_imposters in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Binary Tree such as common_boss, collect_target in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Dynamic Programming such as in beanpole_cut, cookie_collect, lucky_pairs in C++
- Added solutions to problems in BackTracking create_sum, save_yourself in C++
- Added solutions to problems in Graphs such as task_prerequisite, crewmate-imposter-no-one in C++

# New Features

- Devised a new method to take the input of Binary Trees, than to hard-code them in the solution code.
- The Editorial of all the solutions I have contributed is added and can be found [here](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/tree/master/Documentation/Hari%20Krishnan).

Here are some of my PRs

- [#141](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/pull/141) - Added solution to the problem common_boss in C++
- [#128](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/pull/128) - Added solution to the problem save_yourself in C++
- [#46](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/pull/46) - Added solution to the problem climb_stairs in C++

# Future Scope

I believe my work on the NSEC - DSC - Algorithms can help students new to Competitive Programming and Open Source. Also I believe my contributions opens up new avenues for students
aspiring to master Data Structures and Algorithms. I look forward to see some more features in the project like, adding solutions in Python language, Adding more questions from
domains like Bit Manipulation, Queue, Heaps, Greedy, OOP concepts etc.

# Overall Experience

I had an wonderful and exciting winter of 2020, working on DSEC-NSC-Algorithms under the Winter of Code program. I was able to learn about a lot of things including Git and
GitHub, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Markdowns. Also, I experienced the culture of an Open Source program. I was glad to be mentored by Anjali Jha (thanks for going through all my PRs!) and others. I express my sincere thanks to
all co-contributors who worked on DSC-NSC-ALgorithms as part of WoC.
