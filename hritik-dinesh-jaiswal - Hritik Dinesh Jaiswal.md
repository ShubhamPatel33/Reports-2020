- Align images
  - ### *`Goal`*
    Align image of pages that are in different orientations using keypoint matching and a homography matrix so that we can apply OCR to the texts in the page.
  
  
# New Features
  Align the documents using perspective transformation (aka bird eye view).  

  Detailed workflow of algorithm with resultant output is displayed in notebook file and also an written python script for the same.

Here are some of [my PRs](https://github.com/dscnsec/DocScanner/pull/4) 

# Future Scope

Future scope is to develop the application to detect bill/invoice from given images.

**Text extraction** :
Applying OCR on the pre-processed image to get the required text on the bill.

# Overall Experience

Working on open-source development brought in new perspectives and gave me insights into being a better developer. 
While I worked at winter of code, I got to experience open-source culture from close quarters, work around developing real solutions, introspect my work and skills, contribute to open source and be better at work. 
I enjoyed every bit of it. To put my work right to meet the expectations of the mentors was a bit challenging. 
Thorough code reviews with more than one pair of eyes looking gave me valuable insights and feedback.
the mentors were extremely helpful and empathetic. From 1v1 meetings to discussions on the docscanner project in google meet and discord, I am grateful for the additional help and support.
It was a great experience and I get great exposure to work in open-source development.
