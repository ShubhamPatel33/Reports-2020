**Overview** 

**CONTRIBUTIONS** 

1. Conversion From Class Component To Functional Component  

Initially, all the components of the web-app Logo Generator were written in class format.Our first task was to convert the Class based component to Function based Component. Each of us took different files and worked on it. I converted the file DSCEditor.js form class to functional based with help of my mentors and peers. 

2. Conversion From JSX to TSX  

Our next task was to convert JSX files into TSX files.TSX categorises all kinds of variables/elements, and also it is widely accepted in the tech world. In order to perform this task I referred to React TSX documentation.  

3. Creating a User Log in/Sign up portal and integrating it with Firebase  

This page/component was created to restrict unknown users from accessing the logos.The frontend of the page was created with the help of materialUI, Reactstrap, CSS. The user was Signed up/Logged in with username(email id) and password.Confirmation or Rejection notifications were also induced, with the help of firebase return statements.Also a user profile portal is being created to display the downloaded/saved logos of the user.The Realtime database of firebase is used to perform the task.The documentation of firebase explaining the storage of blobs had a major impact in coding these functions. 

New Features  

1.Log in/Sign up,User Authentication  2.Preserving user data (under construction)  3.Faster User experience  

Future Scope 

We have already planned and started working on user profile to display the downloaded/saved logos of the user.The users will be able to share their personalised logos with a shareable URL link.  

Experience 

It was a great learning experience for me. The mentors were very kind and helpful. It was my first time contributing to the open source and I am satisfied and happy after this event. I would like to thank my fellow teammates for their dedication and contributions to the project and cheers to a wonderful collaboration
