- Dynamic Programming enhance inbuilt logics and concepts. There are some famous problems which gives you a quick start in DP journey.

# Overall Experience
Overall, my Winter of Code 2020 journey has been an extremely enriching and rewarding one. My proposal got accepted in the eduAlgo Python Package. My journey in Open Source contribution brings me a sense of accomplishment. From day one only I started to make a productive contribution and PRs which later merged in the codebase. I am thankful to  DSC NSEC & eduAlgo Team for this opportunity to gain valuable experience and allow me to be a part of this wonderful event.
