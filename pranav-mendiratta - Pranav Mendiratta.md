### Tesseract Coding : NeoAlgo

#### The project NeoAlgo is an open-source initiative to bring all the data-structures and algorithms under one roof for all the beginners in this domain of Computer Science. My work over this winter has been to solve any existing issues, update algorithms and new algrithms to the this repository.

### I am Pranav Mendiratta, undergrad from Amity University, Noida worked on NeoAlgo as a part of Winter of Code

#### This project was mentored by - Harsh Bardhan Mishra, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Shraddha V Prasad and Abhinav Anand.

# Some of my Contributions and Features-
- Added Program for Rat in Maze Problem in Python [#1501](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1501)-
Rat in Maze is a tricky as well as famous interview problem so adding this to the list was a no-brainer.
<br />
- Added program for Sudoku Solver problem in Python [#1530](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1530)-
Everybody loves solving Sudoku so I definitely had to add this one.
<br />
- Added program for Breadth First Search in Python [#1569](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1569)-
Graphs problems always seem hard to everyone so added this with a lot of explanation to make the concept easy to understand for everyone.
<br />
- Added program for Depth First Search in Python [#1570](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1570)
<br />
- Added program for Matrix Chain Multiplication in Python [#1591](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1591)-
A very famous and favorites for all the interviewers is this problem of Dynamic Programming that I contributed to this repo with all the explanations.
<br />
- Added program for Swapping Nodes in a Linked List in Python [#1739](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1739)
<br />
- Added program for Diameter of a Binary Tree Problem in Python [#1897](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/pull/1897)


# Some of the Issues I Raised-
- Adding Backtracking Algorithms [#1475](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/)
- Imporving Python Folder structure [#1476](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1476)
- Adding MCM problem [#1474](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1474)
- Diameter of a Binary Tree problem [#1802](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1802)
- Adding Graph Traversal Algorithms [#1528](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1528)

# Future Scope
I feel that me work for the NeoAlgo repositry under Tesseract Coding organization will not only benefit a lot of beginners in the future to learn algorithms but also industry professionals to easily find all algorithms under one roof. It has great potential and I definitely think of contributing more to it in the future.

# Overall Experience
The overall experience was really good. Learnt alot about the industry standards and how to write clean code and code that is understandable by everyone. All the mentors were very helpful and helped me contribute and simultaneously learn a lot of new things.
