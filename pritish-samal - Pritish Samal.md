- ###  Added responsiveness to the landing page and the cards in the homepage
  [#8 made the cards as well as landing page responsive](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/pull/8)

  So, initially the documentation page was okay in the desktop(lg) view but it was falling apart in the tablet(md) or mobile view(sm). That was the first issue that I fixed. Now, the site is completely responsive in every mode.

- ###  Revamped the existing site footer
  [#9 UI enhancement: footer modified](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/pull/9)

### Initially, the footer was looking dull. I revamped the existing footer and added a new footer using flexbox keeping the theme of the site intact which was important.

**Initial Footer :**

Here are some of [my PRs](https://github.com/edualgo/documentation/commits?author=CIPHERTron) 

## **Future Scope**
Since the site is responsive and SEO friendly, users can easily reach out to it. It's also fully responsive now. Thus, users can refer to the documentation in any mode and developers can also add any new package without thinking about its responsiveness. 

## **Overall Experience**
It is really an amazing experience for me to work for eduAlgo. Specially thanks to the project admin **Mr. Abhijit Tripathy** for exposing me to the real-world problems and helping me solving the problems. Got to learn many things from him. Thanks for the whole Winter of Code community to provide such an amazing environment to let me enjoy the coding for the whole winter.
