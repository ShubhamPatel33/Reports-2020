## 1) [Adding Notification Feature](https://github.com/dsc-iem/blog/pull/45/)
This was my main objective.\
I have added/modified the following things while implementing this feature:
- Added a new model **Alert** to store/handle different types of notifications. 
- Added supporting functions for Alert Model for common use like group alerts, mark alerts seen, and many more.
- Modifying existing APIs to generate new alerts.
- Creating API endpoints to send alerts and mark them as seen.
- Adding a Notification Modal in the frontend and integrating it with the backend.\
Here is it's [PR](https://github.com/dsc-iem/blog/pull/45/).
## 2) [Added Floating Alert](https://github.com/dsc-iem/blog/pull/48)
This is the complementary feature to the notification feature. Here the user will get a floating alert on the right side screen to alert them of new alerts.\
Here is it's [PR](https://github.com/dsc-iem/blog/pull/48)
## 3) [Mute Notification](https://github.com/dsc-iem/blog/pull/50)

# Future Scope
I certainly feel that my contributions have added a major feature that this project was missing. Making this project better and more robust. In the future, I would look forward to seeing the following feature:
- Push Notification.
- Notification Sound.
- Missed Notification Email.\
I am also even looking forward to work on some of them.
