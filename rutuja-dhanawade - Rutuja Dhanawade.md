# New Features
I worked on followig new features:

- [Bulb Switcher problem ](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1668)
- [Stock span problem](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1566)
- [Unique BST](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1455)
- [majority vote algorithm](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1439)

# Small Bugs
I fixed following bugs from the codebase.

- [Optimising moore algorithm in java](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/1852)
- [Optimizing Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/issues/241)


# Future Scope
In NeoAlgo project many things can be implemented some of them are following:

- There are some programs that can optimized.
- Broken links in markdowns of all languages.
- GitHub actions ( code quality checker).
- Adding more algorithms.


# Overall Experience

This was a wonderful experience for me to be a part of this awesome initiative. I enjoyed while contributing to neoalgo under winter of code 2020. This program also helped me to improve my coding style. All the mentors were helpful during the whole program. Specifically, I would like to thank @iamrajiv, @plazzy99, @atarax665, @HarshCasper for their constant support and their comments helped me in a number of my PRs. So overall it was unforgettable and a great learning experience for me. Looking forward to being part of more such initiatives and open source programs.
