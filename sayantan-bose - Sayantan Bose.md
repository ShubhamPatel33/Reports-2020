# Future Scope
-> There are many algorithms whose time complexity or the space complexity
can be reduced more
-> As Data Structure and Algorithms a demanded topic so the number of question
can eventually be increased so that it give a greater scope for a beginner 
to learn dsa in a much proper way
-> This will help for solving some good questions which will in term help
for the preparation of a dsa interview

# Overall Experience
It was a wonderful program which helped me in learning git and github which 
is an atmost requirement for an open source developer. Apart from this it gave 
me a great scope in brushing up my dsa algo skills which is very important
for a person aiming for software developement role. Overall its a great program
and I really had a productive winter.
