* Added editorials of all the problems that can be seen [here](https://github.com/dscnsec/DSC-NSEC-Algorithms/tree/master/Documentation/Tamonash_Chakraborty).

# Future Scope-
If given the opportunity, I would like to work on this repository again. As I have already completed every task that had been assigned to me, I would definitely be looking forward to the new problems. If luck(and pluck) permits, I would enjoy taking up the role of a mentor as well. I wanted to add some problems which wasn't possible this time, I would love to add them the next time.

# Overall Experience-
It was a great experience and I had a lot of fun learning, coding and open sourcing. I would love to express my gratitude to the entire DSC NSEC team for hosting this program, especially [Anubhav Singh](https://github.com/xprilion). I would also thank my mentors, especially [Anjali](https://github.com/anjali1903) and [Joydeep](https://github.com/OverLordAct) who have helped and guided me a lot. Looking forward to WOC 2021.
